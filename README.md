# Greatest-Common-Divisor-Traversal
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, and you are allowed to traverse between its indices. You can traverse between index i and index j, i != j, if and only if gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1, where gcd is the greatest common divisor.  Your task is to determine if for every pair of indices i and j in nums, where i &lt; j
